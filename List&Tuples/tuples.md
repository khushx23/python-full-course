# TUPLES

Tuples are ordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets (). Tuples are unchangeable meaning we can not alter them after creation.

## Tuple Indexes

Each item/element in a tuple has its own unique index. This index can be used to access any particular item from the tuple. The first item has index [0], second item has index [1], third item has index [2] and so on.
```python
country = ("Spain", "Italy", "India", "England", "Germany")
#            [0]      [1]      [2]       [3]        [4]
print(country[1])
print(country[3])
print(country[0])
```
