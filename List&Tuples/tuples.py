#TUPLES IN PYTHON - (list k bhai) - built in data type that lets us save immutable values (like strings)

tuple = [45,35,54,75,52]  #list

tuple = ()   #syntax for tuple , we use curly brackets
tuple = (45,35,54,75,52)
print(tuple[2])  #to access any element we use square brackets

#TUPLE METHODS 

#tuple.index(el) - returns index of first occurence

print(tuple.index(54))

#tuple.count(el) - counts total occurences

print(tuple.count(54))
