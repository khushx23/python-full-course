# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

## 1- IF-ELIF-ELSE statement- 
syntax:

**if**(condition):      #the condition is always checked and returns a value if True

    print(statement 1)          #indentation - leaving spaces (eq to a tab space) for better coding


**elif**(condition):     #the condition is only checked when if return the False value.

    print(statement 2)   

**else**(condition):         #always written at the end of the code.

    print(statement3)

### NOW LETS DIG DEEPER INTO THE CONCEPTS-

*IF STATEMENTS-
A simple if statement works on following principle,

- execute the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates True.

- ignore the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates False and return to the code outside if statement.

*IF-ELSE STATEMENTS-

An if……else statement works on the following principle,

- execute the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.

- execute the block of code inside else statement if the expression evaluates False. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.

*ELIF STATEMENTS-

An elif statement works on the following principle,

- execute the block of code inside if statement if the initial expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

- execute the block of code inside the first elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

- execute the block of code inside the second elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

.

- execute the block of code inside the nth elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

- execute the block of code inside else statement if none of the expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
